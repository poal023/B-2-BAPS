# B-2-BAPS Gimbal Prototype Code

The following folder contains code to move a gimbal via two Arduinos with transmitters communicating.

One arduino should have the gyroscope (BN055), while the other one should have a gimbal and an LCD screen. Both ardiunos should have a 433MHz transmitter to communicate and transmit serial data.
