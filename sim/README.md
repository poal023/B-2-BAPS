# Lock-in Amplifier Simulation

Based off of this blog post: https://cushychicken.github.io/lock-in-amplifier-simulation/

Attempts to simulate a lock-in amplifier. Low-pass filter used in the blog is substitued with a butterworth LPF from scipy.

## Directions

Install the required dependencies by running `python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt`. Afterwards you should be able to run the simulation
